Hello! I am a postdoc at the University of Pennsylvania studying the evolution of galaxies and how the universe came to be.

Galaxy Evolution
======
My research focuses on understanding the distribution of galaxies in terms of their mass. To do this I am measuring the stellar, gas, and dark matter masses of galaxies in a nearby volume of the Universe. 


Observational Cosmolgy
======================
My research focuses on measuring subtle distortions in galaxies due to the presence of matter between us and the observed galaxy. These distortions are known as weak lensing. Weak lensing is the best probe of the buildup of matter in the universe as it is sensitive to all matter (visible and dark). As a member of Euclid and Dark Energy Survey, I am working on developing new methods for measuring these subtle distortions in galaxy shapes.
