Data
====
In Eckert et al. (2015), I present reprocessed GALEX UV, SDSS ugriz, 2MASS JHK, and UKIDSS YHK data for the RESOLVE survey (as well new Swift UVOT m2 data for 19 galaxies). These data are provided in a machine readable table on the RESOLVE website.

In Eckert et al. (2016), I provide the stellar and baryonic mass functions for RESOLVE-B and ECO as well as the mass functions broken down by group halo mass regime and by central/satellite status. These are available for download as an MRT from the online journal version.

In Eckert et al. (2017), I provide group mass estimates using HAM and dynamics for RESOLVE-B and ECO. These are available for download as an MRT from the online journal version.


Software
=======
On my github account I have provided: 
1. An IDL code that computes the volume of a survey given the RA, Dec, and cz limits of the survey.
2. An IDL code and a Python code that produces the full probability density field photometric gas fractions calibrations from Eckert et al. (2015). Given an array of galaxy colors or “modified colors” (linear combination of color and axial ratio), the code will the log(G/S) probability distribution according to the best fit parameters to the model described in Eckert et al. (2015) as shown in the figure below.
